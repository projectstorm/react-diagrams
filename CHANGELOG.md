__6.0.0__

Note: This is a complete rewrite of the library, a good place to start to see how the new system works
is with the new demo project which illustrates the new capability.

I would also recommend taking a look at the new updated DiamondPort widget which shows more capability.

* Break up library into monorepo
* Introduce react-canvas-core as a new framework
* Use geometry classes instead of raw X and Y primitives so we can do matrix stuff in the future
* move testing framework to a name based system instead of ID's
* Introduce multiple layers (can now have multiple node and link layers)
* Rewrote the deserialization system to be promise based
* Completely overhauled the observer framework on the models
* Moved all the logic in the DiagramWidget into a a new hierarchical state machine
* Introduces new states for editing
* Introduced faster layout rendering when transforming the canvas directly
* Moved all canvas smart routing into its own link-type under routing package
* Broke up link rendering into a much more modular system that is much easier to extend
* Introduced port alignment allowing the developer to specify how enter it
* Improved generics throughout the entire model system with Mapped Types
* Rewrote all the styles using emotion instead of sass
* Fixed up all the demos to use the new API
* Introduced a demo project that illustrates how to use the library with ES6 as well as with Typescript
* Improved the grid rendering system to allow graphical elements to specify how they get transformed
* Introduced a performance widget for improving performance in a more deterministic way by comparing the serialization of the model (with a way of opting out)
* Renamed a bunch of methods to be more consistent and more understandable
* Completely removed the double render state system that required nodes to render before links, this is done when ports report their new positions
* Ports can now dynamically be added and removed without having to tell the system it happeend
* Port widgets are now containers dumb containers for you own ports
* Port widgets report new sizing information to their target links when they change position, you no longer need to invalidate them
