**DEMO**: [http://projectstorm.cloud/react-diagrams](http://projectstorm.cloud/react-diagrams)

**DOCS \(wip\)** [https://projectstorm.gitbook.io/react-diagrams](https://projectstorm.gitbook.io/react-diagrams)

Docs are currently being worked on, along with a migration path.

## What

A flow & process orientated diagramming library inspired by **Blender**, **Labview** and **Unreal engine**.

* **Modern Codebase** written entirely in Typescript and React, the library makes use of powerful generics, advanced software engineering principles and is broken up into multiple modules.
* **Hackable and extensible** the entire library including its core can be extended, rewired and re-assembled into fundamentally different software to suit your own software needs.
* **HTML nodes as a first class citizen** the library was originally written to represent advanced dynamic nodes, that are difficult to represent as SVG's due to complex input requirements ux requirements.
* **Designed for process** the library is aimed for software engineers that want to rewire their programs at runtime, and that want to make their software more dynamic.
* **Fast diagram editing** the defaults provided give the highest priority to editing diagrams as fast as possible.

Example implementation using custom models: \(Dylan's personal code\)

Get started with the default models right out of the box:

## Installing

For all the bells and whistles:

```text
yarn add @projectstorm/react-diagrams
```

This includes all the packages listed below \(and works \(mostly and conceptually\) like it used to in version 5.0\)

### A more modular approach

This library now has a more modular design and you can import just the core \(contains no default factories or routing\)

```text
yarn add @projectstorm/react-diagrams-core
```

this is built ontop of the evolving **react-canvas-core** library

```text
yarn add @projectstorm/react-canvas-core
```

which makes use of

```text
yarn add @projectstorm/geometry
```

and of course, you can add some extras:

```text
yarn add @projectstorm/react-diagrams-defaults
yarn add @projectstorm/react-diagrams-routing
```

## How to use

Before running any of the examples, please run `yarn build` in the root. This project is a monorepo, and the packages (including the demos) require the packages to first be built.


Take a look at the [diagram demos](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams/tree/master/diagrams-demo-gallery/demos)

**or**

Take a look at the [demo project](https://github.com/projectstorm/react-diagrams/tree/master/diagrams-demo-project) which contains an example for ES6 as well as Typescript

**or**

[Checkout the docs](https://projectstorm.gitbook.io/react-diagrams/)

## Run the demos

After running `yarn install` and `yarn build`, you must then run: `cd diagrams-demo-gallery && yarn run start`

## Building from source

Simply run `yarn` then `yarn build` or `yarn build:prod` in the root directory and it will spit out the transpiled code and typescript definitions into the dist directory as a single file.
